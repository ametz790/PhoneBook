# PhoneBook

This is a encapsulated phonebook program written in Java which creates a .txt file on the user's desktop and has three main functions:

1. Saving a new contact into the txtfile registry.
2. Searching for a contact by name, showing their phone number.
3. Deleting a contact from the phonebook registry.
